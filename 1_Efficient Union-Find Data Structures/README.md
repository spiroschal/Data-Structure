Efficient Union-Find Data Structures

This project focuses on implementing and comparing two union-find data structures for managing disjoint sets efficiently. Both structures represent sets as trees with designated representative elements. The provided example illustrates two initial sets, each with a representative element. Set storage is handled via an array, "Pi," where the parent of an element is determined by Pi[v]. The first data structure, Simple Union-Find, implements the basic quick-union algorithm and provides functions for finding, uniting, and counting sets. The second structure, Weighted Union-Find with Path Compression, improves efficiency by considering set sizes and compressing paths during find operations. Both structures are tested and compared using the RandomUnions program with varying element counts.
