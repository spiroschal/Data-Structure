Enhancing a Binary Search Tree to a Red-Black Tree

The "BinarySearchTree.java" program originally implements a basic binary search tree to store and manage items with keys. To transform it into a Red-Black Tree, each node must now carry an extra boolean variable, "isRed," to denote red or black nodes. Maintaining balance during insertions necessitates a "fix" method, which handles tree rotations and adjustments to ensure that no red node has a red child, upholding Red-Black Tree properties. Implementing auxiliary methods like "rotateLeft" and "rotateRight" helps manage node re-coloring and restructuring. Additionally, the program utilizes methods like "updateNode" and "updatePath" to keep track of node heights and descendant counts, crucial for maintaining structural integrity. This conversion enhances the tree's efficiency for applications requiring balanced search trees.
