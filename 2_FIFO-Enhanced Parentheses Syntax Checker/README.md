FIFO-Enhanced Parentheses Syntax Checker

In the "Parentheses.java" program, you are tasked with completing a Java application that verifies the correctness of nested parentheses, including three types: (), [], and {}. The program reads an input sequence and uses a stack data structure to check for valid nesting of parentheses. It also stores the positions of corresponding left and right parentheses if the sequence is syntactically correct. The program employs a queue to manage these positions. You will implement the ParseInput method to perform these tasks and PrintOutput to display the results. The program will indicate whether the input sequence is valid or not.

The "FIFO-Enhanced Parentheses Syntax Checker" is a Java program that utilizes two key data structures to validate nested parentheses in input sequences. It leverages a stack for real-time syntax verification, ensuring every opening parenthesis has a matching closing parenthesis. In addition, it employs a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue to store positions of matched parentheses, revealing the hierarchical structure of nested sets. This application not only offers a practical solution for checking syntax but also underscores the significance of these fundamental data structures. It serves as an excellent example of how stack and FIFO queue can be harnessed to solve complex syntax-related challenges effectively.
